# Comparing Reinforcement Learning Algorithms in Unity  

A-Level Computer Science NEA project implementing and comparing **Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT)** in a Unity-based simulation.  

## Skills & Technologies  
- **Machine Learning & AI** – Implemented DQN, PPO, and NEAT from scratch, including neural networks, genetic algorithms, and policy optimization techniques.  
- **C# & Unity** – Developed a configurable simulation environment, integrating AI agents with Unity’s physics engine.  
- **Data Structures & Algorithms** – Designed custom memory buffers, backpropagation methods, and evolutionary mutation strategies.  
- **Data Visualization & Analysis** – Exported agent performance metrics to CSV, implemented graphing functions for statistical analysis.  
- **Software Engineering Principles** – Modular and scalable codebase with object-oriented design, clear separation of concerns, and configurable parameters.  

## Implemented Features  
- **Custom DQN, PPO, and NEAT implementations** with adjustable hyperparameters.  
- **Unity 3D simulation** where AI-controlled agents learn in a game of tag.  
- **Custom neural network architecture** for training RL agents, including activation functions, weight updates, and gradient descent.  
- **Genetic algorithm implementation** for NEAT, supporting mutations, crossover, and species differentiation.  
- **User interface & configuration system** for real-time algorithm adjustments.  
- **Automated data collection & visualization**, exporting performance metrics for analysis.
